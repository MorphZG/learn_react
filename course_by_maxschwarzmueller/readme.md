## Book Course

Second edition of the book written for React 19 release. Though most of the core concepts have been around for some time now and most of the features covered can be considered extremely stable and unlikely to change.

For possible corrections and deviations there is a `CHANGELOG.md` file available on main branch of [github.com/repository](https://github.com/mschwarzmueller/book-react-key-concepts-e2/blob/main)
