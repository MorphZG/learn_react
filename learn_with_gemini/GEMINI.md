# Project: "React.js learning course - from fundamentals toa dvanced"

## Goal
The main goal of this project is to create a course for anyone with solid understanding of HTML, CSS and Javascript.
First plan the roadmap by splitting the complete course into few large parts:
 - Fundamentals
 - Intermediate
 - Advanced.
Each of those big three sections of the course should cover related sub sections or chapters.
