### How to Use `GEMINI.md`

Place a `GEMINI.md` file in the root of your project directory. Hereâ€™s what you should put in it:

1.  **Project Overview:** A brief description of the project's purpose and goals.
2.  **Build & Run Commands:** The exact shell commands to build, test, lint, and run the project. This is the most important section.
3.  **Tech Stack & Conventions:** Key libraries, frameworks, and architectural patterns used. Mention coding style (e.g., "use Prettier for formatting," "prefer functional components in React").
4.  **Important File Locations:** Pointers to key files like configuration, main entry points, or critical modules.

### What NOT to Include

*   **Secrets:** Never store API keys, passwords, or any sensitive credentials in this file.
*   **Temporary Instructions:** Use the chat prompt for one-off tasks. `GEMINI.md` is for persistent, project-level guidance.
*   **Personal Preferences:** For personal, non-project-related facts you want me to remember, use the `save_memory` tool (e.g., "Remember my preferred editor is Neovim").
