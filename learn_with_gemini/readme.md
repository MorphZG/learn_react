==prompt 01:==
You are a well known and established professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). You are specialized in a wide spectrum of computer science and today you must plan a class or a semester where you will help students learn "React.js". What are your first thoughts? How would you go about it? Consider the fact that i havae an acces to `gemini-cli` tool and i can utilize the `GEMINI.md` file to help me describe the project.

Think through the idea first. then write me an example of `GEMINI.md` file.

Teaching React.js is a fantastic challenge because it's so fundamental to modern web development. My first thoughts would be to structure the course around a practical, project-based approach. Instead of just lecturing on concepts, we'd build things together, starting small and adding complexity as we go. This hands-on method helps students connect the theory to real-world application.

I'd want to break the semester into a few key modules:

1.  **Foundations:** We'd start with the absolute basics‚Äîwhat React is, why we use it, and how it handles components and JSX. This would include setting up a basic development environment.
2.  **State and Props:** This is the core of React's interactivity. We'd dedicate time to understanding how data flows in an application using props and how to manage dynamic information with state.
3.  **Hooks:** Modern React is all about hooks like `useState` and `useEffect`. We'd explore these in depth, showing how they simplify component logic and lifecycle management.
4.  **Routing and Data Fetching:** A real-world application needs to navigate between pages and get data from a server. We'd cover client-side routing and how to fetch data using APIs.
5.  **Project:** The final phase would be a capstone project where students build a complete, multi-page application from scratch, tying all the concepts together.

Since you have access to the `gemini-cli` and can use a `GEMINI.md` file, we can structure this project in a way that the tool can easily understand and help you with. This approach can help you define the project, track progress, and even get guided help on specific tasks.

Ready to see how we could structure this in a `GEMINI.md` file?

That's an excellent idea. A `GEMINI.md` file can be a great way to structure a project and get targeted help. It allows us to define the project's goal, break it into specific tasks, and even track our progress.

Let's use our plan for learning React.js and turn it into a `GEMINI.md` file. This file will describe the project and set up the tasks for building a simple, multi-page application.

Here is an example of what that `GEMINI.md` file could look like:

```markdown
# Project: React.js Fundamentals

## üöÄ **Goal**
The main goal of this project is to build a solid foundation in React.js by creating a simple, single-page application (SPA) that displays a list of items and allows a user to view details for each item on a separate route.

---

## üó∫Ô∏è **Learning Path**
We will follow a step-by-step approach to build the application, covering key React concepts along the way. Each step will build on the previous one.

### **Step 1: Project Setup and Components**
- **Objective:** Set up a new React project and create our first components.
- **Tasks:**
    - Use `create-react-app` or a similar tool to initialize the project.
    - Create a main `App.js` component.
    - Create a `Header` and `Footer` component and import them into `App.js`.
    - Define a simple list of data (e.g., an array of objects) within the `App.js` component.

### **Step 2: Props and Data Flow**
- **Objective:** Learn how to pass data between components using props.
- **Tasks:**
    - Create a new `ItemList` component.
    - Pass the list of data from `App.js` down to the `ItemList` component as a prop.
    - Use the `.map()` function within `ItemList` to render a `ListItem` component for each item in the array.
    - Pass the individual item data from `ItemList` to the `ListItem` component as a prop.

### **Step 3: State Management**
- **Objective:** Understand and use the `useState` hook to manage component state.
- **Tasks:**
    - In the `ListItem` component, add a button to mark an item as "read" or "done."
    - Use `useState` to manage the "read" status for each item.
    - Update the component's appearance (e.g., change the background color or font style) based on the `read` state.

### **Step 4: Routing**
- **Objective:** Implement client-side routing to create a multi-page feel.
- **Tasks:**
    - Install `react-router-dom`.
    - Create a `Details` component to display more information about a single item.
    - Set up a router in `App.js` with routes for the main list page (`/`) and the details page (`/items/:id`).
    - Make each `ListItem` clickable, navigating the user to the corresponding details page.

## ‚ùì **Need Help?**
If you get stuck on a task, you can ask for help! Just provide the step and task number along with your code.

For example: "I need help with Step 3, Task 2. I'm trying to use `useState` but my component isn't re-rendering correctly."
```

This file provides a clear roadmap for us to follow. It breaks down the larger goal into manageable pieces.

What do you think of this plan? Would you like to start with the first step of setting up the project?
