### book by Alex Banks and Eve Porcello

"This is the React book thatâ€™s been missing from the frontend community. Alex and Eve not only discuss React in-depth but cover foundational JavaScript concepts, testing, state management, and more. Plus, they do so with approachable language and humor. I cannot recommend Learning React highly enough." - Emma Bostian, Software Engineer at Spotify
